Visdom

Combine geographical load shape

we only have zipcodes, not latlon

what does visdom do:
	meter -> extract features -> ccrete consumer modeels -> find interventions ->
	the whole timeseries fof customers reduced to a set of features
	vizs:
		load shapes
	things we dont do very well:
		mean of features on a map
		we dont have the specific latlon of the home: we can make up the latlon in the zipcodes
		feature + spatial


suggest spatial/temporal viz + animations:
	100,000 meters, zipcode + temporal, spatial
	per zipcode ~5000 customers

questions: 
	I want to have a tool that generates questions
	Massive Spatial-Temporal Visualization of Cyber-Physical Social Systems.

we'll work with ca. 10,000 meters. 
	timeseries, features, projected load shape, 

cool question we can answer with this:
	what is the impact of of adopting battery.

	we have to talk one-on-one
